# Setting Up Your Development Environment

As developers, we may work on many different kinds of software projects. Each one will require us to use different components and tools to build out. This combination of components and tools, and the various utilities, scripts and apps that are required to run them all together, make up a "development environment". 

It is best to maintain a fluid notion of what a "development environment" is, or what tools are in that environment, because it is likely to change for every project you work on. It will even evolve in long-term projects over time as new techniques become available. 

Some developers are keen to push their development environments further and further, which is great for the rest of us. Invariably, those developers invent new ways of doing things that become so convenient that everyone wants to adopt their methods. But it's not crucial that you become highly skilled in conceiving and constructing complex development environments.

For many other developers, the development environment is something that should fade away to the background of their work process. They don't want to think about all the things that are going into making sites build and run: Rather, they wish to focus entirely on the project of building a great site or application. For these developers, it can never be too simple or too convenient.

It's good to know a little bit about what sort of developer you think you are: Do you like to fiddle with the pieces? Or do you want to focus on the code? This is related to another decision we must make very quickly: Do you want to work in a hosted environment? Or would you prefer to work "local"?

# Nesting and Imports: Set Up Your Stylesheets

In order to make the most of our new CSS preprocessor, let's set up our stylesheets for further development. We need to establish our file structure and set up our imports to allow us to write clean, well-organized code that makes the most of the SCSS nesting capabilities to create an obvious hierarchy.

## Locate your stylesheet
As we saw when we bootstrapped the site, the stylesheets for our project are located at `app/styles/`. As part of the bootstrapping process, a `main.scss` file was created and some styles were added there to support the project skeleton homepage.

Open `app/styles/main.scss` and observe the styles that have been pre-created for you. There is a `.browsehappy` style, which is an element that shows up when outdated browsers hit your page. (You can find that element, and the code that makes it appear,  in the `app/index.html` file.)

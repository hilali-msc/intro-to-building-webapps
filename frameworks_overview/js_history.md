# A Brief History of Javascript in Web Development
The web is a strange place. We use all sorts of technologies to create websites that do all sorts of things. We use Java and Ruby and Python and PHP and myriad other language; we use nginx and Apache and Tornado and Twisted and all sorts of servers made for specific purposes; we use mySQL and Posgresql and MongoDB and Cassandra to store data for use in dynamic applications. This list just barely hints at the surface of how diverse and complex the server-side components of any given web application can be.

On the client-side, things are quite a bit different.

Web browsers are built to adhere to standards. Most of the core standards and specifications governing the Web are created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C publishes standards that, for example, govern how Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) should be interpreted, how Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) work, and what APIs are revealed on the Document Object Model (DOM). These standards then dictate what browsers do when they receive HTML, CSS and Javascript from the server.

And that's a key point: The browser itself only understands HTML, CSS and Javascript. Functionality can be expanded using plugins and extensions, but those are browser-specific and proprietary. At the fundamental level, all websites boil down to the HTML, CSS and Javascript.

HTML is the core building block of any given webpage. The HTML provides a structure that defines the content on the page so the browser "knows" what exists in that page. CSS is a means of configuring the visual presentation of HTML elements. HTML structure allows CSS to reference content on the page using element names, classes, or IDs, tying the HTML and CSS together directly.

Javascript interacts with the page using the DOM, which is a programmatic representation of the structure of the HTML. The browser downloads the HTML, reads it, interprets it, and then holds the dynamic, programmatic representation of that HTML, the DOM, in memory while the page is being viewed.

Of the three primary web technologies that make a page live and breathe in your browser, Javascript is the only one that is a programming language. HTML is a markup language: it describes content using HTML elements. CSS is a configuration language: it defines settings for visual presentation of HTML elements. Javascript is a programming language: it allows you to create logical definitions and structures that can provide dynamic response to user actions.

Because Javascript is the only programming language that is interpreted and executed in the web browser, it enjoys a special place in the world of web development. This is why Javascript is so important.

# Configure `grunt-build-control`
For the most part, we will configure `grunt-build-control` just like we did for our webapp experiments. We will still be deploying our AngularJS sites to Github Pages because although we are creating much more complex Javascript applications, we are still only building a static website that requires no dynamic server to deliver. This is another of the amazing things about working with Javascript webapps.

# Install `grunt-build-control`
The `grunt-build-control` component must be installed into each project where you want to use it. Install it as usual and don't forget to add the `--save-dev` flag so your project remembers that you are using `grunt-build-control`. Run this command to install `grunt-build-control`:

```bash
npm install grunt-build-control --save-dev
```

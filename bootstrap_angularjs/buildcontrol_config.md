# Configure `grunt-build-control`
For the most part, we will configure `grunt-build-control` just like we did for our webapp experiments. We will still be deploying our AngularJS sites to Github Pages because although we are creating much more complex Javascript applications, we are still only building a static website that requires no dynamic server to deliver. This is another of the amazing things about working with Javascript webapps.

# Prerequisites for Using Data APIs
Most APIs you might leverage in a Single Page Application (SPA) will require you to sign up, and possibly even go through some approval process, in order to consume their data. For the purposes of experimentation, it's good to stick with "open" data APIs, many of which are provided by various government agencies, non-profit organizations, and various other outlets. Many for-profit companies offer very liberal API usage to developers, while others restrict their API access to approved partners. 

# Open Weather Map
For the purposes of this book, I will leverage the data available from OpenWeatherMap.org (OWM). This is a service run by a private company, but with very liberal usage policies. You can learn more about OpenWeatherMap.org on their About Us page. (Please note: Neither I nor this book is in any way affiliated with OWM. For the purposes of the work we will do here, you may substitute any other REST API service that will return JSON. There are a lot of those.)

In order to use OWM's API, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you will be given an API key, which you can find on [your "My Home" page](http://home.openweathermap.org/) after you have logged in. (Click the "Hello" link in the upper right of the site if you can't find [your "My Home" page](http://home.openweathermap.org/).

The My Home page looks like this:

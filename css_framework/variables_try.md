# Customizing Variables

Since we're already working with Bootstrap, it makes sense to leverage as much of it as possible. This is only possible if we use the `_variables.scss` file to customize the variable values for our project.

The values in `_variables.scss` control everything from the color palette for the site, the sizes at which the grid system breaks down for `xs`, `sm`, `md`, and `lg` sized screens, and the font families that are used for your site.

# Create a Test Repo
For this and the next couple of sections, we will do some experimentation in a test repository before we get into our final webapp repository. In order to work through all of our experiments, we need to create a repository on Github.

Github has a great guide to creating repositories: [Github Create a Repository Guide](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

Follow that guide and create a new repository. (It should be empty except the README file.) Once you've completed that, return to your development machine and clone the repository to your development environment.

## Clone Your Test Repo
If you are using the Github app for Mac or Windows, you can easily clone your new repository there. If you have any trouble, consult the appropriate Help guide:

* [Github for Windows Help](https://windows.github.com/help.html)
* [Github for Mac Help](https://mac.github.com/help.html)

If you are using a command line Git interface, you may use the following command to clone your repo. (Be sure to copy the SSH Clone URL from your repository home page and paste it into the command.)

```html
git clone <SSH_CLONE_URL>
```

Once you have the repository successfully cloned to your local machine, you can move on.

**NOTE FOR HOSTED DEV ENVIRONMENTS**<br>
If you are using a hosted development environment, it is very possible that you need to supply the SSH Clone URL when you first create your devbox. (This is the case, for example, with Code Anywhere.) Keep this in mind and adjust your process here to accommodate whatever your hosted service provider recommends.

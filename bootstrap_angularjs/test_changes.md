# Change Making
In order to get a little taste of how the AngularJS views system works, we will make some simple changes to our views. 

First, open the `app/views/main.html` file. Notice that it contains the familiar HTML defining the jumbotron and "'Allo! 'Allo!" message we see on so many Yeoman templates. Change some of the text to custom text of your own. (Don't overthink it!) 

Notice that when you save changes to this file, your web browser preview will update. (You did run `grunt serve` in your project directory before starting to make changes, right?)

Since this project has Bootstrap connected, you can use Bootstrap-specific styles or HTML structures to modify your page. Try making a few changes.

Once you're satisfied that you see how `main.html` is working, open `app/views/about.html` and make some changes there, too. Click back and forth between the Home and the About screens. Do you see how your changes are being inserted into a very specific place in your application? This is the area that your views have to work with.

If you feel like you're running on steam and you need to conclude this phase of our project, feel free to continue. But if you'd like to experiment with a simple AngularJS-powered enhancement to a template, then try this extra stretch goal.

## Stretch Goal: Make an adding machine.
To test out some of the core features of AngularJS, we will recreate the example we had in the previous chapter.

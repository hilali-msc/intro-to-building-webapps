# Install Yeoman and Friends
Once you have Node.js installed, getting Yeoman, Bower, Grunt (and even Gulp) installed is easy. You can do it all in one command by running:

```bash
npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli gulp-cli
```

Once that process completes, you can check on your installation by running the `yo doctor` command. The output should look something like this:

```bash
$ yo doctor

Yeoman Doctor
Running sanity checks on your system

✔ Global configuration file is valid
✔ No .bowerrc file in home directory
✔ No .yo-rc.json file in home directory
✔ NODE_PATH matches the npm root

Everything looks all right!
```

Now you are ready to begin bootstrapping projects from templates. Woo-hoo!

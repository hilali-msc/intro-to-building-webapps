# Conclusion
You have now bootstrapped a new project skeleton for your AngularJS webapp. You have modified the initial project skeleton to use `grunt-sass` instead of `compass`, and you have configured deployment scripts to use `grunt-build-control` to deploy your files to Github Pages whenever you wish.

You have explored the files created by the Yeoman generator, and you have scratched the surface of making cool AngularJS apps. 

You are well on your way to creating a fresh, new webapp. Congratulations!

See you in the next chapter.

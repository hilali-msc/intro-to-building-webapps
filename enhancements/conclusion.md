# Conclusion
You have successfully added helpful animation and messaging to your app, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in usability. This does not mean that you are finished with your app. You now must continue to discover more ways to improve the experience for your users.

In order to continue building on your app's features and usability, you should consider pursuing some of these goals:

* Add a "save city" button to the forecast view, and duplicate the proper messaging.
* Use weather icon symbols to create animated design elements to spice up your current weather and forecast pages.
* Add proper error messaging for API calls in your services. (And implement those messages in the proper templates.)

Above all, you should continue to work on the design and visual presentation of the app. What you have here is a basically functional webapp, but it lacks the personality and attractive visual styling that will truly make users embrace it. There is a virtually unlimited terrain for exploration here, so let your imagination run wild.

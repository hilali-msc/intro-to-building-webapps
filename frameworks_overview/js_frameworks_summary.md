# Summary of Major Javascript Application Frameworks
There are many Single Page Application Frameworks (SPAFs) available for building websites with Javascript. These were created to ease the pain of making more responsive webapps that can run in the browser. The developers of these frameworks have borrowed, modified, imagined, and otherwise generated a wide range of approaches to addressing the challenge of building a webapp. 

What follows is a short list of some of the popular SPAFs that are not AngularJS. This book will use AngularJS as the primary example framework, so we will cover it on consecutive pages. For now, let's survey the landscape.

## Backbone
Backbone was one of the first Javascript-based SPAFs to come out. It tends to be farily "unopinionated", which means that it does not make many requirements about how you organize your code. Backbone is still a very popular tool, and there are many supporting libraries and modules that can enhance Backbone apps (such as Marionette and Thorax).

Backbone is a small framework, and many developers like that. If you're the kind of developer who likes to read all the source of the tools you're using, then Backbone makes that easy. For more experienced Javsacript developers, Backbone can be a great blend of enough structure to keep you sane, but not so much that you feel fenced in. For less experienced developers, Backbone will give you plenty enough rope to hang yourself, so follow guides and best practices.

## Ember

## React

## Meteor

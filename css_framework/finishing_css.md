# Finishing Up Our Style Experiments

Keep experimenting with writing styles and modifying this site until you get comfortable with the core features of SASS and SCSS. It can be tricky to get into these techniques at first, but they will save you time and make edits much quicker in the future.

Once you have completed your experiments, don't forget to commit and push your changes using Git:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'Experimenting with styles'
git push origin
```

Or, if you're using the Github Application, just go into that tool, provide a commit message, then click the "Commit and Sync" button.

## Additional SASS/SCSS Learning Resources
This book does not go terribly in-depth on how to use SASS and SCSS to create styles (you pretty much just read the bulk of our styles discussion). For the most part, you will apply all of the CSS knowledge that you have to your stylesheets as you normally would. But as you work through the tasks prescribed here, you may want to check out these resources for additional guidance and insight:
